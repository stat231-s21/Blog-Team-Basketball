# Introduction
## Motivation
So much of a positive career is determined by the circumstances surrounding it. Maybe you got the job because you were in the right place at the right time, or you missed the interview because of a flat tire and didn't get the job. For players in the National Basketball Association, these circumstances are often experienced as what schools they attended and teams were they traded to. With this project we set out to discover if the circumstances around who players wore across their chests impacted overall career success. Did players that knew more players than others have more successful careers? Is connection early on in a basketball player's journey - say high school or college - more indicative of a successful career? 

Another question we set out to address is how do we measure success? We have decided to stick to the most quantitative measures of success, career statistics. Specifically, we are returning to the value over replacement player (VORP) statistic, but our visualizations allow for the user to choose the statistic they want to use to measure success by, from field goal percentage (FG%) to total number of rebounds (TRB). 

## Research Questions
- DOES CONNECTION EQUAL CAREER SUCCESS ? (measured in VORP)
- How connected are current NBA players?
- Is an early connection to NBA stars an indicator of career success?
- How do we measure success?

Let's clean up the format of that output:

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")
        , row.names = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped"
                , full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, underline = T) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Speed of car (mph)"
       , y = "Distance taken to stop (ft)"
       , title = "cars data (1920s)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
