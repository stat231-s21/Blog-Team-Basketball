# Introduction
## Motivation
So much of a positive career is determined by the circumstances surrounding it. Maybe you got the job because you were in the right place at the right time, or you missed the interview because of a flat tire and didn't get the job. For players in the National Basketball Association, these circumstances are often experienced as what schools they attended and teams were they traded to. With this project we set out to discover if the circumstances around who players wore across their chests impacted overall career success. Further, it is possible that playing with other successful players helped improve a players' skills and set them up for success. Different coaching staffs on different teams could've also made an impact on players' skills. Did players that knew more players than others have more successful careers? Is connection early on in a basketball player's journey - say high school or college - more indicative of a successful career? 

Another question we set out to address is how do we measure success? We have decided to stick to the most quantitative measures of success, career statistics. Specifically, we are returning to the value over replacement player (VORP) statistic, but our visualizations allow for the user to choose the statistic they want to use to measure success by, from field goal percentage (FG%) to total number of rebounds (TRB). 

## Research Questions
* Does connection equal career success? (measured in VORP)
* How connected are current NBA players?
* Is an early connection to NBA stars an indicator of career success?
* How do we measure success?

# Background
## Background on Topic
Basketball players play in one of 30 NBA teams. Players can leave a team via a trade (where a team exchanges the player for another), being waived and re-signed by another team (typically when a player underpreforms), being drafted into a team, or being signed as a free agent at the end of a contract (or at the beginning of a career). 

As for Colleges and High Schools, typically only the "star" players of high schools tend to make it to the NBA. There are, however, some exceptions as some programs are notorious for creating NBA talent. Players can transfer between schools in these two levels. 


## Data Sources
The dataset we utilized for this investigation was scraped from basketball-reference.com. We scraped each team's roster from 2010-2021, which high school and college each player attended, and some relevant statistics for each player. In total, 6616 instances of a player were scraped. 

# Findings
## Success
We begin our search for these answers by attempting to quantify player success through various (mostly offensive) game statistics. As mentioned above, the standard that we, as your authors and data scientists, chose to measure success by is VORP due to the fact it is a calculated statistic that attempts to weigh many simple stats. This algorithm, which is included in full in the Reference section, attempts to coerce basketball success into one simple number by weighing the perceived importance of various statistics (such as points per game (PPG) and total rebounds per game (TRB)) in addition to the pure statistics of each player's career. BPM, or Box Plus/Minus, is another statistic we decided to include as it is another option for a calculated box score based metric (). It is anothere weighted estimate of a player's contribution to their team. Where BPM just looks at how much a player helps or hurts their team when they are on the court, VORP takes that and weighs by the number of minutes the player is on the court for, with the idea that better players are playing more minutes. We urge you to take a strong look at the VORP and BPM tabs especially if you are less familiar with basketball. You are also welcome to look into the purer career statistics we have included, nobably field goal percentage, PPG, and TRB.

# Conclusion
## Limitations
* No data on AAU teams
  + Many players played on AAU or other similar High School level teams outside of their actual high school. It is certain that we missed some connections there, but this data is not readily available.

* No data on International Teams
  + Many players played internationally before coming to the NBA. We have no readily available data for those teams so connections were again missed. International players, specifically, may have also not attended High School and College in the U.S. and are therefore excluded from those respective networks.  

* One-team players
  + Some players have played the majority (or the entirety) of their careers with a single team. This means they have less connections, but they could still be extremely successful. A network analysis could still give us useful information about these players if we look at the network of teammates they had over time but this analysis is beyond the scope of this blog.

## Conclusion

Players that knew each other in HS and college ....

Players that were more connected tended to....


## Future Research
* As mentioned earlier, one can create an analysis of how many successful teammates a certain player had over time which can help fix the One-team player issue.

* One can also potentially attempt to find some type of centrality in the networks to see if a specific player or team has had the most connections. 

* One can also make directed networks out of trades and see which teams tend to "bleed" talent or teams that "find" talent
